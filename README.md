RAG System Proof of Concept and Evaluation

This project involves building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system as a proof of concept to improve document search and question answering for a tech company’s engineering and marketing teams. The goal is to explore how RAG can accelerate internal workflows and support future GenAI product development.

The process includes:
Implementing a RAG pipeline using LangChain, including components for embeddings, chunking, vector search, and LLM integration.
Working with a labeled dataset ("gold answers") to evaluate the system's response quality.
Experimenting with tunable hyperparameters (e.g., model choice, chunk size, embedding method) to optimize performance.
Developing evaluation metrics to measure how closely the system replicates the gold answers.
Writing a 4–5 page business proposal detailing findings, optimal configurations, risks, and limitations.
The deliverables include a functioning RAG system, a series of tested configurations, performance analysis, and a final report summarizing system performance and business recommendations.
